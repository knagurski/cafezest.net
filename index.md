Situated in the commercial heart of the Waterside in the historic city of
Derry/Londonderry, we are an independently owned coffee shop/bistro and outside
caterers. Since opening in February 2007 we have placed ourselves at the
forefront of the city’s emerging cafe culture providing:

* Outside catering
* Extensive breakfast menu
* Daily hot lunchtime specials
* Wide range of freshly prepared salads and fruit smoothies
* Great selection of speciality Coffees and Teas
* No need to queue: telephone pre order and collection service
